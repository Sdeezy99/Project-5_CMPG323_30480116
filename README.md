# Project-5_CMPG323_30480116

## Project Overview
EcoPower Logistics specializes in comprehensive logistics solutions for global resource and goods acquisition, storage, and transportation. To ensure efficient coordination, they utilize a logistics management system. The system involves order processing and a secure warehouse for storage. Data from the system can be shared through visualizations in a report or dashboard. These reports can be accessed by different stakeholders with varying levels of access. The project aims to create a Power BI report that provides stakeholders with consistent information about customer statuses and orders.
